    "<p style=\"font-size:16px; line-height:1.6;\">\n",
    "This project presents a comprehensive algorithmic trading ecosystem developed in Python, combining quantitative strategy formulation with a robust, modular software architecture. The core investment vehicle is a <strong>\"High-Quality Momentum\" (HQM)</strong> strategy, which selects the top 50 S&amp;P 500 assets based on a composite score of 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year return percentiles. In addition to HQM strategy, a simple version of Relative Strength Index (RSI) strategy is implemented to construct a comparison mechanism, giving the user flexibility over which strategy to use based on their backtest performance. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size:16px; line-height:1.6;\">\n",
    "Supporting this strategy is a custom-built trading engine designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, featuring distinct classes for market data querying, order management (Market and Limit orders), and broker simulation. To ensure system reliability, the engine is validated through a rigorous unit testing suite using <code>pytest</code>. Risk management is enforced via a pre-trade volatility filter—excluding the top decile of most volatile stocks—and a reactive 20% drawdown stop-loss. The system’s performance is validated through historical backtesting against the SPY benchmark, evaluating key metrics such as CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, and volatility to demonstrate both financial viability and technical stability.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size:16px; line-height:1.6;\">\n",
    "The projects aims to extract S&amp;P 500 Index and utilize both HQM and RSI strategies to produce two separate trading strategies and write the strategies into two separate .xlsx file, namely momentum_strategy.xlsx and rsi_strategy.xlsx. Then a few plots will be generated to visualize backtest result supported by the backtest code snippet. Thus, any user can have a trading strategy that is backtested and risk-managed stored in an excel sheet with clear headers and cash amount to be invested, given a certain amount of initial portfolio value.\n",

    "## Results and Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Overview\n",
    "The quantitative backtest, conducted from **January 2024 to January 2025**, reveals that while all implemented strategies were profitable, they underperformed the passive market benchmark during this specific period. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Benchmark Performance:** The **S&P 500 Benchmark (SPY)** delivered the strongest performance, achieving a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of **25.69%** with a high Sharpe Ratio of **1.88**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, the algorithmic strategies yielded more modest results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RSI Strategy:** This was the top-performing algorithmic approach, generating a **14.36% CAGR** with a Sharpe Ratio of **1.04**. Its lower volatility (**11.86%**) compared to the benchmark (12.58%) indicates it successfully identified stable entry points, though it captured less total upside.\n",
    "* **High-Quality Momentum (HQM) Strategy:** This strategy lagged significantly, returning **11.84% CAGR** with the highest volatility of the group (**16.16%**) and a Sharpe Ratio of **0.61**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of Risk Management Protocols\n",
    "A critical observation from the data is that the performance metrics for the \"Stop-Loss\" portfolios are **identical** to their unrestricted counterparts (e.g., HQM at 11.84% is equal to HQM w/ Stop-Loss at 11.84%). \n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the **20% portfolio drawdown trigger was never activated** during the backtesting window. The market environment in 2024 was characterized by a consistent uptrend with shallow corrections; consequently, the portfolio never experienced a peak-to-trough decline severe enough to trigger the defensive exit to cash. While the insurance policy was in place, the market conditions did not necessitate its use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion: The \"Bull Run\" Effect\n",
    "The underperformance of the HQM strategy relative to the SPY is likely attributable to the **market weighting mechanism**. \n",
    "* **Cap-Weighted Benchmark:** The S&P 500 is capitalization-weighted, meaning its 2024 returns were heavily driven by a small handful of mega-cap technology companies (e.g., NVIDIA, Meta) that saw explosive growth. \n",
    "* **Equal-Weighted Strategy:** Our strategy utilizes an **equal-weighted allocation** (investing the same amount into each of the top 50 stocks). In a market where the \"giants\" outperform the average stock, an equal-weighted strategy will mathematically trail the cap-weighted index, even if the stock selection logic is sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion and Future Outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Validation\n",
    "Despite trailing the benchmark in raw returns, the project stands as a successful technical implementation of a robust algorithmic trading engine. The system demonstrated the ability to:\n",
    "1.  Autonomously scrape constituent data.\n",
    "2.  Calculate complex technical indicators (Momentum Percentiles and RSI).\n",
    "3.  Simulate portfolio management logic including volatility filtering and conditional stop-losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the RSI strategy achieved a **Sharpe Ratio above 1.0** demonstrates that the system can identify risk-adjusted value, even if it missed the extreme outliers of the benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Improvement\n",
    "To bridge the performance gap in future iterations, we recommend three key adjustments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Dynamic Rebalancing:** Transitioning from a static one-time purchase to a monthly rebalancing schedule would allow the Momentum strategy to \"ride the winners\" and cut losers, potentially capturing more of the mega-cap upside.\n",
    "2.  **Adaptive Risk Thresholds:** Since the 20% stop-loss was too loose to be useful in this bull market, implementing a tighter, trailing stop-loss (e.g., 10%) or a volatility-adjusted stop (e.g., 2x ATR) might have actively protected profits during minor dips.\n",
    "3.  **Regime-Based Weighting:** Introducing a logic to shift between \"Equal Weight\" and \"Market-Cap Weight\" based on market breadth could allow the algorithm to mimic the benchmark during top-heavy rallies while retaining diversification benefits during normal markets."
